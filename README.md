# API Platform for Laravel Demo (Game Collection)

This is a demo Laravel application (running on [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail) for isolation) showcasing how to build a RESTful API for managing video game collections using [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/docs/laravel/) and Laravel.

API Platform is a powerful and flexible API framework that allows you to build modern APIs in PHP with absolute ease. It removes the endless boilerplate code and provides a set of tools to help you build APIs faster and more efficiently.

For example, if you want to expose a set of CRUD operations for a resource, you can do so with just a few lines of code. API Platform will automatically generate the necessary routes, controllers, and responses for you.

## Features

- [x] RESTful API endpoints for managing video games
- [x] Integration with API Platform for standardized API responses
- [x] Game entity with properties like title, description, collection, reviews, and release date
- [x] Full CRUD operations
- [x] API documentation via OpenAPI/Swagger
- [x] oAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) w/ [Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

## Setup

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jpcaparas/demo-laravel-api-platform.git
```

### Install dependencies
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
composer install
```

### Start the web and DB containers
```bash
sail up
```

### Configure environment
```bash
sail artisan key:generate
```

### Run migrations
```bash
sail artisan migrate --seed
```

## Authentication

### Generate a new Laravel Passport key pair
```bash
sail artisan passport:keys --force
```

### Register for an account

Go to http://localhost/register and create a new account. This will be used for PKCE OAuth 2.0 authentication.

### Generate a new Laravel Passport PKCE OAuth 2.0 client

(To learn more about PKCE, see [OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Apps](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/passport#code-grant-pkce))

ELI12: _PKCE is like having a secret handshake that changes every time you meet - you make up a special code, scramble it before sending it to your friend, then prove it's really you by showing you know the original code that makes that scrambled version! ü§ù‚ú®_

```bash
sail artisan passport:client --public --name=PKCE_CLIENT --redirect_uri=http://localhost/vendor/api-platform/swagger-ui/oauth2-redirect.html
```

(When prompted to enter the user ID of the user to associate with the client, leave it blank so the client can be associated with all users.)

## Testing it out

You can now access the API at `http://localhost/api`.

However, since the routes are protected by authentication, you won't be able to access them directly.

You'll need to use the Swagger UI to authenticate and access the API.

On the top right of the Swagger UI, click the _Authorize_ button and enter `1` as the PKCE client ID (the one we created earlier). No need to enter a client secret.

It will prompt you to log in with the account you created earlier.  

This will create a PKCE OAuth 2.0 token (secret-less) that you can use to access the API.

The token is then automatically appended as a auth header to every request made on the Swagger UI to give you access to the protected API routes:

## Wrapping up

### Stopping the containers
```bash
sail down --volumes
```
